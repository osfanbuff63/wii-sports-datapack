# ws-datapack-scripts

## About

This directory is scripts written in Python used to make the installation process easier. This is not part of the datapack/resource pack project *in any way*, and is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md). The main datapack is licensed under the GPL v3.

## Running

More description is available in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but on Windows download the latest .exe file (released in GitHub Actions with every commit to this directory) and on a Unix-based OS (e.g. macOS, Linux) run the Python script directly (you will need the `python3` or similar package to do this. I am working on a way to do this without python3.)
