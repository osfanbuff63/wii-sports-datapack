# ws-datapack-scripts

## About

This directory is scripts written in Python used to make the installation process easier. This is not part of the datapack/resource pack project *in any way*, and is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md). The main datapack is licensed under the GPL v3.

## Running

More description is available in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but just run the Python script directly. You will need Python 3 to do this, but I am working on a way to do this without python3, however it is still a work in progress.
